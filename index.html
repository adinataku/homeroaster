    <h1>Private Home Roaster Club</h1>
<p>
Get ready for some truly excellent coffee! Adi roasts each small batch with a special Kaleidos M1 sample roaster. He started roasting at home to save money on amount of money he spent buying single origin or high quality blend coffee beans. He like to try different beans. Cut to the chase, honestly, he wishes to share his coffee journey with everyone but it takes too long to roast so many batches in a small roaster. So his hope is that the donation can help him purchase larger capacity roaster so he can do it faster.
</p>
<p>Here's the lowdown:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The bean: Single Origin Sulawesi Honey Enrekang Angin Angin, sourced from Sweet Maria.</li>
    <li>The flavor: You choose! Light, medium, or dark roast, depending on what you're craving.</li>
    <li>The size: Each batch is made with 150g of green beans, which nets you a 100-120g 6oz bag of freshly roasted goodness.</li>
    <li>The bag: Resealable with a one-way valve for freshness. If you need to stash it long-term, tape the valve and pop it in the freezer.</li>
    <li>The wait: It takes a day to get it roasted and taste-tested for quality. You'll get a text when it's ready for mail, delivery, or pickup.</li>
    <li>The hookup: To order or ask questions, call 1-612-209-5825.</li>
</ul>

Adi roasts each small batch with a special Kaleidos M1 sample roaster. To help supporting his coffee addiction,  you can donate any amount. If you have no clue, may we suggest $10 a bag via Venmo (@adi_beamulawarman) or Wise (@adim196). Eventually he will get a bigger roaster with higher capacity and he can get to 200-250g 10oz bag or batch size. He does not intend to do this as a main business so, you get what you get, the beans available will be updated frequently.
