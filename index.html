    <h1>Private Home Roaster Club</h1>
<p>
Get ready for some truly excellent coffee! Adi roasts each small batch with a special Kaleidos M1 sample roaster. He started roasting at home to save money on buying single origin coffee beans. He likes to try different beans from different farms from different countries. Cut to the chase, honestly, he wishes to share his coffee journey with everyone but it takes too long to roast so many batches in a small roaster. So his hope is that the donation can help him purchase larger capacity roaster so he can do it faster.
</p>
<p>Here's the lowdown:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The bean is sourced from Sweet Maria. He mainly buys single origins.</li>
    <li>BeanList updated 1/19/2026.</li>
    <li>Not adding roasts unless requested for a while until he finished his roasted and purchased stock from last year</li>
    <li>Yemen Mokha Sanani.(3 medium roasts, 1 dark roast. Roasted 1/19/2026)</li>
    <li>El Savador Miravalles Yellow Bourbon.(All green gone, 3 medium roasts left. Roasted 12/27/2025)</li>
    <li>Colombia Double Ferment Hulia Pacamara.(All green gone, 3 medium roasts left. Roasted 1/7/2026)</li>
    <li>The flavor: You choose! Light, medium, or dark roast, depending on what you're craving.</li>
    <li>The size: Each batch is made with 150g of green beans, which nets you a 100-120g 6oz bag of freshly roasted goodness.</li>
    <li>The bag: Resealable with a one-way valve for freshness. If you need to stash it long-term, tape the valve and pop it in the freezer.</li>
    <li>The wait: It takes a day to get the beans roasted and taste-tested for quality. You'll get a text when it's ready for mail, delivery, or pickup.</li>
    <li>The hookup: To order or ask questions, text to 1-612-209-5825.</li>
</ul>

Adi roasts each small batch with a special Kaleidos M1 sample roaster. To help supporting his coffee addiction,  you can donate any amount. If you have no clue, may we suggest $10 a bag via PayPal/Venmo (@MGRoaster) or Wise (@adim196). Eventually he will get a bigger roaster with higher capacity and he can get to 200-250g 10oz bag or batch size. He does not intend to do this as a main business so, you get what you get, the BeanList is updated when he gets new beans delivery.
