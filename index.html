    <h1>MG Home Roaster Club</h1>
    <p>All roast is done with sample roaster Kaleidos M1</p>
    <p>To donate send money using Venmo to : xxxx </p>
    <p>or using asdasdasd to : xxxx </p>
    <p>Currently most batch goes in as 150g into the roaster. Output depends on the roast level. </p>
    <p>You will receive approximately somewhere between 100g - 120g </p>
    <p>The bag that coffee will have one way valve, the best place to keep your coffee is in the bag.</p>
    <p>If you are not going to use the beans right away, you can tape the value and store it in the freezer.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Available beans depend on seasons. It will take me a day to roast and cup the result before</p>
    <p>it is available for mail/delivery/pickup.</p>
    <p>If you see a bean you like to try, let me know what roast level you want. I mainly source green beans from Sweet Maria.</p>
