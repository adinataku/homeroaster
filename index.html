    <h1>Private Home Roaster Club</h1>
<p>
Get ready for some truly excellent coffee! Adi roasts each small batch with a special Kaleidos M1 sample roaster. You can donate just $10 a bag via Venmo (@adi_beamulawarman) or Wise (@adim196).
</p>
<p>Here's the lowdown:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The bean: Single Origin Sulawesi Honey Enrekang Angin Angin, sourced from Sweet Maria.</li>
    <li>The flavor: You choose! Light, medium, or dark roast, depending on what you're craving.</li>
    <li>The size: Each batch is made with 150g of green beans, which nets you a 100-120g 6oz bag of freshly roasted goodness.</li>
    <li>The bag: Resealable with a one-way valve for freshness. If you need to stash it long-term, tape the valve and pop it in the freezer.</li>
    <li>The wait: It takes a day to get it roasted and taste-tested for quality. You'll get a text when it's ready for mail, delivery, or pickup.</li>
    <li>The hookup: To order or ask questions, call 1-612-209-5825.</li>
</ul>
